**Is this actually a feature request?**
Bugs are for reporting things that don't work, rather than things that work but feel clunky or don't work as well as they should. If things _technically_ work, but you think they can be improved, please go back and pick "feature request" instead. Bugs are purely for when something's genuinely broken.
